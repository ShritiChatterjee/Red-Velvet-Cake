STEP 1

Heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4 and line two 18cm sandwich tins with baking paper. Stir the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Beat the eggs and add to the oil and buttermilk, then stir in the food colouring. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry and then beat them together with an electric whisk until a smooth batter forms.

STEP 2

Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 25-30 minutes or until risen and a skewer poked into the centres of the cakes comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.

STEP 3

To make the frosting, beat the butter and icing sugar together until smooth, then beat in the soft cheese. Put a layer of frosting between the cake layers and then use the rest to frost the cake.
