This is a recipe of a cake of the flavour red velvet. The cake is red in colour due to food colour added into it and it has a texture that feels like velvet and so it is known as a red velvet cake. The cake is super moist from the inside and super attractive from outside. Usually white frosting is used in red velvet cakes to give a nice contrast between red and white. The red velvet cake can be served without a frosting too.
